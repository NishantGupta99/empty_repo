let hello = "world" ; // if we hover our mouse over the hello word we can see ts is returning a data type as world weher as in js we will get it as string 
hello = "Bangalore" ; // and if we try to reasign the value it will give us an error here on the coding page aswell as the watch mode because we have defined hello as a constant that means we cannot redefine hello but if we replace const with let we can redefine the same. 
let firstName :string = " nishant"; // in order to set name as a stirng we will use : after the variable or constant name 
firstName = 7; // now if we try to reassign the value of firstName as a number or boolean value it will give us error here itself but we can always save it to a string
