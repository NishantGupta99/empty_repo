const hello = "world" ; // if we hover our mouse over the hello word we can see ts is returning a data type as world weher as in js we will get it as string 
hello = "nishant" ; // and if we try to reasign the value it will give us an error here on the coding page aswell as the watch mode because we have defined hello as a constant
