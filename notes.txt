1. to install type script go to gitbash and write npm i -g typescript 
2. every type script will have .ts extention 
3. a ts file cannot be run on a browser like a js file so everytime we create a ts file we need to transpile the same to do that  use gitbash and write tsc followed by the file name this will create a js file for the same.
