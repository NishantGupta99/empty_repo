1. to install type script go to gitbash and write npm i -g typescript 
2. every type script will have .ts extention 
3. a ts file cannot be run on a browser like a js file so everytime we create a ts file we need to transpile the same to do that  use gitbash and write tsc followed by the file name this will create a js file for the same. 
4. create a tsconfig.json folder in which we will tell the complier hwre the ts files will be stored and where the transpiled files should be stored 
5. create two folders srs for all the files with ts extention and dist for all the transpiled js files.
